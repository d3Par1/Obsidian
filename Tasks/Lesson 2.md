3.Which of these things would you want most: to watch your pet / to talk to your pet / to

Petcube is a smart device that was created in Kyiv in 2012 by three Ukrainian friends. They had a
dog that often felt lonely when they were at work, so they decided to design something new.
The first Petcube allowed owners to watch their pets through a small camera and even play with
them using a built-in laser pointer. Later versions have included a microphone and a speaker, so
people can talk to their pets, and some models can even throw treats remotely.
Petcube has quickly grown from a small start-up into an international company. Today, its
products have been sold in more than 18 countries and are especially popular in the United States.
Many pet owners say it has made life easier and more fun, both for them and for their animals.
Petcube has also helped to show the world that Ukraine is a centre of creative and useful
technology.

Later, it became popular with professionals who needed to write clear emails and reports. Grammarly
can correct grammar, spelling and vocabulary errors, but it also suggests how to improve style and
tone. The app works as a website, a browser extension and a mobile app, so people can use it almost
anywhere. Today, Grammarly has more than 30 million daily users and has become one of the

plans, so each person can follow advice that suits their lifestyle. It includes video workouts, meal ideas and even short
meditations.
The app has become popular worldwide and today it has reached more than 100 million downloads in 190 countries.

health conditions. The company’s mission is simple: to make a healthy lifestyle easier and more enjoyable for everyone.

  Be ready to explain your choice.

       Which way of communicating do you usually use the most? Why?
WhatsApp is one of the most popular communication apps in the world. It has allowed people to send free text messages, make voice and video calls, and
share photos, videos and documents. Today, more than two billion people in over 180 countries use it every month.
The app was co-founded in 2009 by Jan Koum, who was born in Ukraine and later moved to the United States. He grew up in a poor family, and his experiences
have inspired him to make communication simple and affordable for everyone. His idea was simple: to create an easy, free and private way to stay in touch
with family and friends. WhatsApp has quickly become popular because it works on almost every type of phone and only needs an internet connection.
In 2014, Facebook bought WhatsApp, but the app has stayed independent and has continued to grow. It has changed the way people communicate and has
made the world feel much smaller.
a) Facebook bought WhatsApp. _____
b) Jan Koum co-founded WhatsApp. _____
