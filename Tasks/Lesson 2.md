Petcube is a smart device that was created in Kyiv in 2012 by three Ukrainian friends. They had a
dog that often felt lonely when they were at work, so they decided to design something new.
The first Petcube allowed owners to watch their pets through a small camera and even play with
them using a built-in laser pointer. Later versions have included a microphone and a speaker, so
people can talk to their pets, and some models can even throw treats remotely.
Petcube has quickly grown from a small start-up into an international company. Today, its
products have been sold in more than 18 countries and are especially popular in the United States.
Many pet owners say it has made life easier and more fun, both for them and for their animals.
Petcube has also helped to show the world that Ukraine is a centre of creative and useful
technology.

I was surprised that...
